# System setup

Those powershell scripts are aimed to quickly install common applications on a fresh Windows system. It currently uses **Scoop** and **Winget** (not chocolatey, because it is slower). Winget does not offer auto-update at the moment

You may want to customize them and create your own version(s), for example to add browsers of your choice. *Note:* if you do not want to install an application of every sessions, remove the "--global" option for scoop installs.
